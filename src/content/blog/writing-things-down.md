How much stuffs did you write down today?

As time goes by, more I believe that you need to write things down more and more. Documenting stuffs is a good way to believe in the long term game.

Writing is a good way to put your thoughts in a paper (or anything else) and validate if they make sense. If you are missing some point that is important to understand all the context behind the subject.

Writing is a good way to align your ideas with other people. Comparing the idea and checking what you don't know yet.

Everyone should write things down. Just write things down.
