In December 26th, 2023, I started my new and current vault in Obsidian and was one of the best decisions that I could bring to my 2023. Now I'm doing the review around this beautiful tool that follows me in my entire year.

In the last years of my life, I turned more and more a heavily user of note-taking tools, even those _"rudimentar"_ ones like a pen and paper, I already tried a lot of tools around this subject, like Logseq, Notion, Bear, Apple Notes, Evernote, and finally Emacs with [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), when I thought that would be the state of the art of note-taking tools for me, and yes, I think that Emacs with org-mode is one of the best tools that I've used in my entire life. And I used it for about two years, and was really good.

Although I was really liking using org-mode, I was always in a feeling that would have a tool that fits my workflow in an easier way, I'd like to just put words into a file and push it to a place where I could find it easier in the future.  And well, I think that I finally found it.

## Obsidian and My Workflow

I think that the most powerful philosophy around Obsidian is the concept of [File over App](https://stephango.com/file-over-app), that Steph Ango writes about. By the fact that it's just a tool that handles markdown in a prettier way and you can enhance this experience with some community plugins, you can have an infinite ways to manage your workflow.

By this fact, it's one of the core arguments that shows why I think that Obsidian was the best tool for me at that moment, and fits it until now. If I want to move it to another app or build my own solution, I can just need to handle a bunch of Markdown files and everything will works great, it's a future-proof solution.

My workflow is simple despite the range of community plugins and what you can do inside a vault, I just have 6 plugins, being them plugins that helps me automatize some jobs, as the Commander, QuickAdd and Templater. And the Dataview, a query language plugin, that helps me to do some specific tooling around my notes, but avoid it too much as possible.

I try to maintain each note more raw as possible, just with what we can found in Markdown by default, because I want to helps me to migrate to another software if I need too in the future.

## Obsidian and My Learnings

I would say that it's a awesome year for my note-taking habits in general. I could developed more about this habit and I can found what are the exactly ways that works for me. I don't know everything yet, and every day I try to improve some aspect of this habit, but I already saw a lot of improvements in my entire life just taking some notes during my day.

Some statistics about what I did in my 2023 year with Obsdian:

- I wrote a total of 512 notes.
- 227 of them are daily journaling, that is ~44.33% of my entire vault.
- 251 of them are related to my _Zettelkasten_, that is ~49% of my entire vault.
- 30 of them are draft of blog posts that I hope some day will be the light , that is ~5.85% of my vault.
- I added 107 tags between the files, being the \#computer-science the most used tag, with 130 files.

These are some statistics related to my work on my vault in this year, I believe that 2024 will be greater than that.

And the major learning related to my adventure with Obsidian was: note-taking isn't about the tools that you use, but about your process. A great process gives to you the opportunity to arrange your notes in a creative, better way that fits your expectations. Regardless of being Notion, Obsidian or just using your pen and a notebook. What really matters is your process.

By the way, this is the graph of my Obsidian in the day that I wrote this post, let's see how it will be in the next year:
