Thinking in Systems is one of the best books that I read in 2023. To be honest,
I can't absorb all the knowledge that this work writes down.

The idea around all this book is to give you a better idea around how systems works,
in a internal, rational way. As an introduction to _"non system thinkers"_, the book
proposes to show to you.

With that idea in mind, they will presentate a lot of concepts about system domains and,
based on that, it'll introduce a new _"meta"_ mental model that will allow you to see our
non-linear world in a better way.
