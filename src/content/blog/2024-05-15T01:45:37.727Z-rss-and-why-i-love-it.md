Inspired by some discussions through Twitter/X over the last few days, I decided to write
about RSS and why I love them. I think it's a great technology that few people know
about and I think it's worth learning more about it.

One of the greatest things that the Internet could bring to us is data consumption.
Do you already ask yourself how much data we consume compared with the past?
How easy is it to just type something into a search engine and get a lot of information about it?
Is just awesome.

But, with great power comes great responsibility. And with a lot of information comes a lot of noise.
I'm a person who likes to read blogs and learn new things, it's a great hobby and it's cool
to see other people sharing their thoughts about something, being tech or not. And by that fact, I,
being a lazy person, was thinking so hard about how to keep up with all the blogs that I like to read.

And then, I found RSS feeds. I would say a cool invention from the 2000s that is still more useful for us
nowadays than it was in the past. What a great idea would be just to aggregate every blog that you like to read
into one place and just read it from there. Simple, but you can see how amazing is it?

The ability to have all those blogs in one place, ensuring that every new update will be there for
easy access, being notified about it and also being able to read it offline is just amazing. And that's why
I love RSS feeds. It's a simple technology that is still useful for us nowadays and I hope it will be for a long time.

This is my RSS feed reader, NetNewsWire. On that, I have all the things I like to follow: blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels,
newsletters, etc. I have more than 100 feeds there and I can't imagine my life without it. All links that you can find
on [bookmarks](/bookmarks) come from that feed reader.

Being an ADHD person, I think that having this kind of tool is helpful for me. I let my NetNewsWire open all the time
and just read the things that I like when I have time. It's a great way to keep up with the things that I like to read and
also a great way to keep my mind busy with something that I like.

I hope you enjoyed this post and I hope you can give a try to RSS feeds. It's a great technology that is still useful for us.

If you would like to follow my blog, you can use my [RSS feed](/rss.xml) that I have here.
I am sharing my OPML file (the same one you saw in the image above), if you want some
suggestions of cool blogs to follow, you can get them [here](https://gist.github.com/noghartt/53e05e6bccb41e9fd69e24fa36ec65ce).
