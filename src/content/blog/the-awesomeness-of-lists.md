List is a feature that goes through our lives forever. Like the lists from the school materials when you're a 6 years old or even the list of things that you need to buy. It's a really powerful tool that compounds an entire range of data anywhere.

You can compound and have a lot of useful data that contextualizes you about everything in a specific scope by doing a list, like me, that does a list about what are the key points that I want to write about in this post.

Lists are a universal tool for productivity, everything can be compound into a list or can be considered a list. For example, the post-its that we have around your office wall they can be treated as a list, you can evenly handle it recursively, putting new lists inside a list.

The fact that you can build this solution in a lot of different solutions easily helps us to maintain a lot of lists with an easily performance. You can have your supermarket lists written in pieces of paper, and a list of blogs that you follow written in a gist in GitHub, or even a thread at Twitter with the list of the coolest blog posts that you read, [like me](https://twitter.com/noghartt/status/1521123090587082752).

Being a forgetful with a considerably low attention-span, I found in lists a useful, disciplined way to go through my daily routine. I have lists to handle my routine, like:

- What I need to do on my job or at home;
- What are the meetings;
- What I need to follow-up;
- What I didn't do;

(I intentionally put a list above.)

But I don't handle only my daily tasks as this structure, I like to put all my useful resources into it too. My notes has a lot of lists around it. For example, a list for the blogs and podcasts that I like to follow, what are the tracking of the books that I'm reading (or already read) over the year, and everything that I think that will be useful for me at some moment.

All these features make me a really enjoyer of lists in general. They are an universal, easily tool of thought that helps us to derive through your day and the entire range of things happening at the same time. We should be more concerned about it and see the entire power of this simple solution that follows us for the entire life.

This is my _ode to lists_. Thanks.
