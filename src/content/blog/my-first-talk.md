In the last September 16th, 2023, I did my first talk ever in a meetup. In Belo Horizonte,
happened the first JSParty Brasil.

The experience of giving a talk, seeing the public listening to you, they looking for your
slides while you explaining the aiming topic is awesome.

The idea behind the talk was to show a presentation about the codemod culture behind Woovi.
How we scale refactor in a large codebase (more than 500k LOC) and how we move faster
with these refactors.
