The last weeks were too hard for me. I need to spend too much time doing things
in my personal life and ensure that I can bring good work to my professional life.

For me, when this happens, there are always difficult moments. These moments are
always complicated because they impacted me in different areas of my life, which
 generated a vicious cycle of bad moments and anxiety.

But, the last time that this happened, in the same scenario, I learned a new aspect
of life that hadn't clicked for me yet, but it's a too simple idea that someone can ask:
"Dude, it's too obvious. Why in the hell you didn't understand it before?". And my
answer would be: I don't know.

You need to learn to embrace the chaos happening in your life and use it as a motion to
stay on track with the things you need to do. As everyone one day said, life is like a
rollercoaster with ups and downs, and you can't avoid the down moments of your life.
What matters is how you approach them.
